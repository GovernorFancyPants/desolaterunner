I"$<p>This will be the first time I run any of the UTMB races. Iâ€™m really looking forward to it and this new type of trail. Sweden and Stockholm in particular is rather flat compared to the alpes. Itâ€™ll be interesting to see how the body reacts to a lot of vertical.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t done much running since Swedish Alpine Ultra but my legs feel ok and Iâ€™ve been commuting to work by bike to get some alternative training. Iâ€™ve never run with poles before so Iâ€™ve been concentrating on getting used to them up and down smaller hills around Stockholm. I think Iâ€™m as physically ready as I can hope to be. Now I just need to get my gear in order. I did some looking around the old interwebs after seeing the obligatory equipment list and found some useful info. So I thought Iâ€™d give you my take on packing incase you or someone else might need it in the future.</p>

<p>A definitive list of obligatory equipment can be found at the <a href="http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/359/Equipment%20advices.html">UTMB website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="obligatory-equipment">Obligatory equipment</h2>

<p><strong>Mobile phone with option enabling its use in the three countries</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™ll just use my <em>iPhone 5SE</em>, it should work fine. Iâ€™ve also saved the organizations number to my contacts.</p>

<p><strong>Personal beaker 15cl. minimum</strong></p>

<p>I will use the <em>Salomon soft cup 15ml</em></p>

<p><strong>Stock of water minimum 1 litre</strong></p>

<p>I use the <em>Salomon S-lab Sense Ultra Set (3l)</em> running vest which comes with two 500ml soft flasks. But this year itâ€™s going to be extremely hot with 32C at 1000m so itâ€™s necessary to have a stock of 2 litres. Iâ€™ll carry two extra soft flasks in my pack to use if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Two torches in good working condition with replacement batteries for each torch</strong></p>

<p>I rarely use torches in training and when I do I just use a cheap Black Diamond torch. So for this Iâ€™ve barrowed a <em>Petzl Nao</em> and a <em>Black Diamond ION</em>. Since spare batteries also is obligatory Iâ€™ll have four AAA batteries, two for each torch.</p>

<p><strong>Survival blanket 1.40m x 2m minimum</strong></p>

<p>Regular gold and silver survival blanket. Comes with all Salomon running vests.</p>

<p><strong>Whistle</strong></p>

<p>A whistle comes with, and is attached to the running vest.</p>

<p><strong>Adhesive elastic band</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m using one that actually is for animals and can be found in your local drugstore, works like a charm.</p>

<p><strong>Food reserve</strong></p>

<p>I will carry 2 Cliff bars (I donâ€™t intend to eat these, they serve as emergency food), a bunch of Gels, Bloks and Chews.</p>

<p><strong>Jacket, with a hood</strong></p>

<p>I love my <em>Northface Storm Stow Jacket</em>. Itâ€™s a great super light rain jacket that definitely will do the trick.</p>

<p><strong>Long running trousers or leggings</strong></p>

<p><em>Peak Performance LAVVU tights</em> is a great pair of tights, fits well with good pockets.</p>

<p><strong>Additional warm midlayer top</strong></p>

<p>This one was the hardest for me to decide since there are two options, but ultimately I went for the second one. My base layer will probably qualify for option one as well, but Iâ€™ll bring a wind jacket too, mostly because of flexibility.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One single midlayer long sleeve top for warmth (cotton excluded) with a minimum weight of 180g (Men, size M)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A two piece clothing combination of a long sleeve baselayer/midlayer for warmth (cotton excluded) with a minimum weight of 110g (Men, size M) and a windproof jacket with DWR (Durable Water Repellent) protection	OBLIGATORY</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I will use my <em>Ullmax Merino Super Soft</em> base layer top and the <em>Salomon S-lab Light Jacket</em>. The only problem though is that the jacket doesnâ€™t seem to have DWR, I think itâ€™s gonna be ok anyways and if not Iâ€™ll borrow a HaglÃ¶fs LIM wind jacket.</p>

<p><strong>Cap or bandana or Buff</strong></p>

<p>I found a really old Shell gas station cap that I use for races and a <em>Svantes Vilt &amp; BÃ¤r</em> buff.</p>

<p><strong>Warm hat</strong></p>

<p>When I ran Ursvik Ultra I got the official hat, comfortable and warm.</p>

<p><strong>Warm and waterproof gloves</strong></p>

<p><em>Icebreaker Quantum Gloves</em> and regular household rubber gloves since itâ€™s almost impossible to find waterproof gloves worth their name.</p>

<p><strong>Waterproof over-trousers</strong></p>

<p><em>North Face Storm Stow Pant</em>, the pants are just as great as the jacket.</p>

<p><strong>Identity papers</strong></p>

<p>This is required by the frontier police forces. Iâ€™ll just have my regular drivers license.</p>

<h2 id="strongly-recommended-equipment">Strongly recommended equipment</h2>

<p><strong>Walking poles</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve borrowed a pair of <em>Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The sum of 20 â‚¬ minimum</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™ll carry some more cash than advised and a credit card just in case.</p>

<h2 id="my-extra-equipment">My extra equipment</h2>

<p><strong>Music</strong></p>

<p>I tend to always bring my iPod shuffle with me during races but very rarely use it. Itâ€™s more of a comfort thing, if i feel really disconsolate I know I have it with me.</p>

<p><strong>Drybag</strong></p>

<p>Invaluable piece of gear. Keeps all of my spare clothes dry and very effective in minimizing space waste.</p>

<p><strong>Shades</strong></p>

<p>In case itâ€™s sunny I like to protect my eyes by wearing cheap plastic and of course stylish shades from <em>Toyshades</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Waterproof phone case</strong></p>

<p><em>LOKSAK</em> makes great sealable bags for your phone. You can still use the phone when in the bag and itâ€™s crazy waterproof.</p>

<h2 id="on-my-body">On my body</h2>

<p>I will start the race, depending on the weather forecast, with shorts, running t-shirt, <em>New Balance Minimus Trail 00v2</em> shoes, <em>Suunto Ambit3 HR</em> and a pair of light Merino wool socks from <em>SmartWool</em>.</p>

<p>Total weight of my pack, excluding what Iâ€™ll wear on my body and reserves of 1 litre, will be around 3kg.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s everything Iâ€™ll be bringing along the trail. I might add, remove or replace something in the coming days but this is more or less it. Looking forward to get down to Chamonix on Wednesday and feel the athmosphere, itâ€™s suppossed to be something else.</p>
