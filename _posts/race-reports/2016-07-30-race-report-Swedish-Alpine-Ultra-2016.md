## SAU - Swedish Alpine Ultra 107k 2016

Let's start from the beginning. I've had, not a terrible, pre-season heading upp to SAU. I did Ursvik Ultra in an ok time, not as well as I'd hoped but still ok. I'll post a quick report on that race later on. But after that I couldn't really get into running again, something was always aching or I'd get a cold. So when it was finally time for SAU, I hadn't gotten the milage I wanted and I didn't feel I was in the best shape for this race.

The day before I went for an easy test run along Kungsleden but almost emediately I felt something was wrong, I got dissy and really tired just after a couple of kilometers, I turned back and felt extremly hungrig even though I had been eating well all day and just finished of a plate of fish and potatoes. I started to doubt I could do the race when I felt like I did. 107 kilometers in the mountains is not something you want to do if you're not feeling 100%.

**Race day**
