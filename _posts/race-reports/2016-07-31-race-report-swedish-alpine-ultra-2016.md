## SAU - Swedish Alpine Ultra 107k 2016

Let's start from the beginning. I've had, not a terrible, pre-season heading upp to SAU. I did Ursvik Ultra in an ok time, not as well as I'd hoped but still ok. I'll post a quick report on that race later on. But after that I couldn't really get into running again, something was always aching or I'd get a cold. So when it was finally time for SAU, I hadn't gotten the milage I wanted and I didn't feel I was in the best shape for this race.

The day before I went for an easy test run along Kungsleden but almost emediately I felt something was wrong, I got dissy and really tired just after a couple of kilometers, I turned back and felt extremly hungrig even though I had been eating well all day and just finished of a plate of fish and potatoes. I started to doubt I could do the race when I felt like I did. 107 kilometers in the mountains is not something you want to do if you're not feeling 100%.

After my run we all went to the chapel for the regular pre race meeting. We got some info on the trail, it was looking good this year with little snow and good conditions overall, and had a few laughs.

**Race day**

I woke up early on race day, hoping the breakfast would be served a little earlier than announced. Unfortunately it didn't, it opened right on time. I had some food and than went on to pack the last things for the race. Adjusting the amount of gels and so on, got dressed and ready for start.

When I got to the start a lot of excited runners were already there. Ready to get out on the trail. After a group photo and some chatter runners amongst, it was time to start. When Roland shouted it was time to go, a small group of runners took off in a staggering pace. I knew I wanted to be among the firsts so I ran right behind them. Even if I had to quit I wanted to get a good start. I felt good in the beginning but I knew I couldn't keep up with this tempo for long. My stomach started to act up almost right away and I felt sick as soon as I thought about eating something. I decided right away, if I couldn't get something in my stomach before Kebnekaise I would have to quit the race.

After a while I noticed it was only four of us left my brother Jonas, Sten, another guy and me. That's where I started slow down, I knew they weren't going to keep up that kind of pace, or at least I hoped so, and I thought I had gotten a bit of space to the runners behind me. So settled for a bit more comfortable pace but after just a kilometer or two I saw someone ahead of me it wasn't my brother nor was it Sten but I felt good catching someone. We ran together for a little while, chatting, but soon I felt I needed to push on. I didn't want to leave to much of a gap to the front runners.

## Kebnekaise

Halfway to Keb I meet my brother who have decided to quit the race because of a previous injury. I tell him I'll probably join him soon if I can't manage to eat something. He wishes me luck and we move on in different directions. I keep going and feel a little better, most likely because of the slower pace. When I have just a couple of kilometers left to Keb I try to eat a gel and to my suprise it goed well.
