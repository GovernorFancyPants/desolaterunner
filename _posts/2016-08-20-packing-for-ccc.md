Less than a week to go to CCC and time to go through the obligatory equipment. I always try to check my equipment about a week before a race, just to give me some time to complement any thing that's missing. 

I haven't done much running since Swedish Alpine Ultra but my legs feel ok and I've been comuting to work on my bike to get some alternative training. I've never run with poles before so I've been concentrating on getting used to them up and down smaller hills around Stockholm. I think I'm as physically ready as I can hope. Now I just need to get my gear in order. I did some looking aroung on the old interwebs after looking at the obligatory equipment and found some useful info, so I thought I'd give you my take on packing incase you or someone else might need it in the future. Note that I'll only list the not obligatory items if I plan to bring them.

## Obligatory equipment

**Mobile phone with option enabling its use in the three countries**

I'll just use my **iPhone 5SE**, it should work fine. I've also saved the organizations number to my phone book.

**Personal beaker 15cl. minimum**

I will use the **Salomon soft cup 15ml**

**Stock of water minimum 1 litre**

I use the **Salomon S-lab Sense Ultra Set (3l)** running vest which comes with two 500ml soft flasks.

**Two torches in good working condition with replacement batteries for each torch**

I rarely use torches in training and when I do I just use a cheap Black Diamond torch. So for this I've barrowed a **Petzl Nao** and a **Black Diamond ION**. Since spare batteries also is obligatory I'll have four AA batteries, two for each torch.

**Survival blanket 1.40m x 2m minimum**

Regular gold and silver survival blanket. Comes with all Salomon running vests.

**Whistle**

A whistle comes with and is attached to the running vest.

**Adhesive elastic band**

I'm using one that actually is for animals and can be found in your local drugstore, works like a charm.

**Food reserve**

I will carry 2 Cliff Bars (I don't intend to eat these, they serve as emergency food), Gels, Bloks, Chews

**Jacket, with a hood**

I love my **Northface Storm Stow**. It's a great super light rain jacket that definitely will do the trick.

**Long running trousers or leggings**

Peak Performance LAVU tights

**Additional warm midlayer top**

This one was the hardest for me to decide since there are two options, but ultimately I went for the second one. 
	1. One single midlayer long sleeve top for warmth (cotton excluded) with a minimum weight of 180g (Men, size M) 
	2. A two piece clothing combination of a long sleeve baselayer/midlayer for warmth (cotton excluded) with a minimum weight of 110g (Men, size M) and a windproof jacket with DWR (Durable Water Repellent) protection	OBLIGATORY

I will use my Ullmax Merino Super Soft base layer top and the Salomon S-lab Light Jacket. The only problem though is that the jacket doesn't seem to have DRW, I think it's gonna be ok anyways and if not I'll borrow a Haglöfs LIM wind jacket.

**Cap or bandana or Buff**

Shell and Svantes Vilt och Bär buff

**Warm hat**

Ursvik Ultra

**Warm and waterproof gloves**

Icebreaker Quantum Gloves and regular household gloves

**Waterproof over-trousers**

North Face Storm Stow

**Identity papers**

This is required by the frontier police forces. I'll just have my regular ID card.

## Strongly recommended equipment

**Walking poles**

Black Dimoand Z poles

**The sum of 20 € minimum**

I'll carry some more cash than advised and a credit card just in case.

## My extra equipment

**String**

You never know, it doesn't take much room nor does it weigh much.
