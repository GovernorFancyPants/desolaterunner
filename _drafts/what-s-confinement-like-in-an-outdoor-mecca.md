I live in Chamonix, France, considered by many as the absolute outdoor capital of Europe. When things first started moving around Covid-19 it seemed like this would be the perfect place to be. Having all these amazing surroundings all for ourselves, not many seasonal tourists around and the french weren't likely to come here for vacation during an epidemic. How wrong that all would turn out to be.

**The stats**

It's been a week now where we haven't been able to leave our houses except for absolutely necessary things like grocery shopping, going to the doctor but also for light exercise close to home. This is tough when you have this enormous mountainous playground so close but still so far away. I've decided to approach this thing, at least for now, as an opportunity to rest and reflect, to give my body, which is usually constantly at work, some well deserved slack. Don't get me wrong, I'm still active everyday and I try to be creative but not nearly at the same load as it would normally be. I thought I'd give some examples of what I'm doing in this situation and how I think in the end I will be a better runner for it.

**Sleep**

I sleep a lot now, and I mean A LOT. I feel fairly relaxed at the moment which means I can get 9-10 hours of sleep a night and that just never happens for me normally.

**Drills**

* Favorite drills (strides, skips, high knees, high heels)
* Barefoot running
* Focus on easy effort runs

**Body weight strength**

**Hang board (climbers)**

**Rest and relaxation (no stress)**

**Catching up on projects that would normally feel stressed**

**Getting creative (plans to build hang board, writing etc)**
