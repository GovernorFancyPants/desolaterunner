**UTMB**

Severe stomach cramps, unable to run neither up nor down, unable to get any food in, unable to sleep it off.

The first one is always extremely hard, you can always find a reason to why you could've continued so unless you've withdrawn for a really good reason you will regret it.

**Costa Blanca Trails**

After the first one it gets surprisingly easy, as a matter of fact it's easier to find a reason to quit than to go on and if you're not careful here it turns in to a dark pattern. I've seen athletes who go down this spiral of withdrawal never to return to former glory days. You've got to break the cycle, no matter what and no matter how hard it is you've got to remind yourself of how good it feels to cross the finish line.
