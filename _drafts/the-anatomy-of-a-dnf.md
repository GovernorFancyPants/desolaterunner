**UTMB**

Severe stomach cramps, unable to run neither up nor down, unable to get any food in, unable to sleep it off.

The first one is always extremely hard, you can always find a reason to why you could've continued so unless you've withdrawn for a really good reason you will regret it.

**Beskidy Ultra Trail 90**

When you think you're in the clear and the pattern hasn't even become a pattern yet, the calm before the storm if you'd like. My first international podium and my best international race by far, and it felt great almost from start to finish.

**Costa Blanca Trails**

Hip pain from recent climbing fall, forced to a slow walk and whimper, got way cooled down when the rain came 

After the first one it gets surprisingly easy, as a matter of fact it's easier to find a reason to quit than to go on and if you're not careful it turns in to a dark pattern real fast. I've seen athletes who go down this spiral of withdrawal never to return to former glory days. You've got to break the cycle, no matter what and no matter how hard it is you've got to remind yourself of how good it feels to cross the finish line.

**Lavaredo**

Sprained ankle on the first descent, continued for another 40k before pulling the plugg.

Some seem like they should be more clear than others but that's not always the case. As soon as I heard the loud crack when rolling it the forth or fifth time I knew it was bad but chose to ignore it, I thought maybe it would be ok as long as I kept moving. After another 30k it was clear I wasn't going to finish the race no matter what.

**Swedish Alpine Ultra**

Not recovered from ankle sprain

Sometimes you just want it so much you can't help yourself even though you know the outcome even before the race starts, and sometimes that's ok, cause the goal doesn't always have to be to finish the race. Sometimes the goal is just to get out there and see how long your body can hold up for and turn around when it says enough is enough.

**MCC**

Breaking the pattern for real. After I went out to hard in the 30 degree heat and hit my first split spot on my legs were shattered and from there on it was hanging on for dear life. I wanted to quit so many times and in my mind I found all the excuses but non were good enough, I knew I had to push through all the way to the finish if not only for the sake of finishing.
