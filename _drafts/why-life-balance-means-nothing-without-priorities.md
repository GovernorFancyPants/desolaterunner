I've always strived for some kind of balance in my life and I don't think I'm alone in this. On the one hand I want to work cause I need money to buy food, pay rent, buy running shoes, travel and basically do anything in life. Some things are free but nothing is totally free and nothing is free enough to survive on, at least in a way that's sustainable in the long term. On the other hand though, I just want to do whatever I want whenever I want and I don't want anything to hold me back from doing that. Keeping a steady job kind of has the annoying habit of getting in the way of that.

I've chosen a life where I'm as close to perfect balance as possible.

No 9 to 5 please.

Money is not biggest priority.

I've been looking for balance without priority, it's not possible cause somethings need to come before other things or it just wont work cause science says so.
