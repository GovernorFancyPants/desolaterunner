What is it about mountains that draw us to them? They're almost magnetic. We can't look away when they're in our sight and once they're in our sight it's hard not to want to go there. Some days, when they're not visible, but we still know they are there, we might need a little help to find that motivation. This was one of those days. It was raining at the valley floor when I was meeting up with my friend Petter Restorp. Together we started ascending and then something happened as we got higher and higher on the mountain. I tried to capture that feeling with this film and the essence of what keeps us coming back to a mountain again and again. Enjoy!
