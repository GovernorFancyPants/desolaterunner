TIME 21:49:17

Congrats to everyone finishing anyone of these races!

Pre race:

Pain in left hip and pain in right knee after taking a fall a few weeks earlier, one aborted run during last week before race.

Had a sports massage the day before the race.

Bus left at 4am, got to Courmayeur and sat down for a while, had some breakfast.

First hill:

Pain in left hip and right knee

Disappeared somewhere at the top

Flying on the traverse, fastest km splits

The big climb was hot, I didn't want to finish my water all at ones so I had small sips and was saving the whole way up and at times, above the tree line, the sun was shining and hit me like a torch.

A supporter with a huge danish flag past us and was cheering on and filming.

It was starting to get dark a little while before col du joly, when I got there it was pitch black

trail4runners app started to glitch before col du joly and was sending me the same updates over and over again

The climb up to Col du tricot was truly horrible, so steep and headlights all the way up. I saw a floodlight at the top so at least I knew from the start where I was heading and how far it was but man, it was so steep, one step at a time. I kept telling myself I just needed to move, it didn't have to be fast as long as I moved. I kept checking my pulse, and had been for a while and I knew exactly how hard I could push before it was too much.

130 pulse towards the end to not push myself too hard

Came in with the goal of a sub20 race but also with the knowledge my injuries might make that impossible and knowing that, my goal would quickly change to just finishing. I ended up doing something in between and considering the circumstances I'm satisfied with the end result.

The guy ahead of me on the decent from Col du tricot was screaming and swearing, I couldn't figure out to what or whom. As it turns out he was really mad at his quads which were completely trashed and he was stumbling the whole way down.

My quads were killing me on the last decent but I knew that everyone was hurting there so that was no reason to slow down, on the contrary, I started speeding up. I'm good on the down hills, quad pain wasn't gonna stop me if my hip hadn't yet.
