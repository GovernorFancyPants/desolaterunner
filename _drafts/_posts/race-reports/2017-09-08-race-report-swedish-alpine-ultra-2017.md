**Leading up**

There I was, back in Nikkaloukta again. Ready to toe the line with a lot of familiar faces and a few new ones. Even though I had problems with my back/hip, I had never been so well prepared for this race. That probably says more about my consistency than my form though. Also it looked like the stars would align and both me and my brother would be able to do the race at the same time for once. In the past we've taken turns for a variety of reasons but it seemed like this would be the year.

Everyone was talking about the weather, how much would it rain on race day? How wet was it going to be out there? How much snow was left, more than a couple of years ago? How cold would it be? The questions were many, but the answers were few.

Roland did the countdown and suddenly we were off. Me and Jonas went out in a moderately high pace since this is the most runnable part of the course. After a few hundred meters we noticed no one was chasing us and that's how it would stay for the rest of the race, even though we felt people closing in more than a few times.

Everything went well to Keb, we were there in about 1h45m. Filled up our bottles and continued on. The weather was great, around 8 degrees celcius and a cloudy sky. Just about perfect for running in the mountains.

**Hip pain and dark periods**

In Singi, about 35km in, I started to feel a some pain in my hip and told Jonas so, but we kept on going in the same pace, either it would get worse or it would subside. Thankfully it subsided and I could run unobstructed again but I would later turn out to have some side effects. My quad and my calf had to do some heavy lifting to compensate for my hip not doing it's job and I knew I had to stay in control of it and manage it the rest of the way.

After Sälka Jonas had a dark period, he figured it was because of lack of energy and so started eating bloks. We slowed down the pace a bit, which we had to do anyway because of how technical the trail is right here. It's better to take it slow than to end up standing on your face on top of a sharp rock. After eating an entire pack of bloks in minutes Jonas was sure the lack of energy was the problem and soon we got closer to the Tjäcktja pass and he was back on track again.

**The talked about snow**

Up until Tjäcktja there had barely been any snow
