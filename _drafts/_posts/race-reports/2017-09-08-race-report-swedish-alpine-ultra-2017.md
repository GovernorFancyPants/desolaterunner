**Leading up**

There I was, back in Nikkaloukta again. Ready to toe the line with a lot of familiar faces and a few new ones. Even though I had problems with my back/hip, I had never been so well prepared for this race. That probably says more about my consistency than my form though. Also it looked like the stars would align and both me and my brother would be able to do the race at the same time for once. In the past we've taken turns for a variety of reasons but it seemed like this would be the year.

Everyone was talking about the weather, how much would it rain on race day? How wet was it going to be out there? How much snow was left, more than a couple of years ago? How cold would it be? The questions were many, but the answers were few.

Roland did the countdown and suddenly we were off. Me and Jonas went out in a moderately high pace since this is the most runnable part of the course. After a few hundred meters we noticed no one was chasing us and that's how it would stay for the rest of the race, even though we felt people closing in more than a few times.

Everything went well to Keb, we were there in about 1h45m. Filled up our bottles and continued on. The weather was great, around 8 degrees celcius and a cloudy sky. Just about perfect for running in the mountains.

**Hip pain and dark periods**

In Singi, about 35km in, I started to feel a some pain in my hip and told Jonas so, but we kept on going in the same pace, either it would get worse or it would subside. Thankfully it subsided and I could run unobstructed again but I would later turn out to have some side effects. My quad and my calf had to do some heavy lifting to compensate for my hip not doing it's job and I knew I had to stay in control of it and manage it the rest of the way.

After Sälka Jonas had a dark period, he figured it was because of lack of energy and so started eating bloks. We slowed down the pace a bit, which we had to do anyway because of how technical the trail is right here. It's better to take it slow than to end up standing on your face on top of a sharp rock. After eating an entire pack of bloks in minutes Jonas was sure the lack of energy was the problem and soon we got closer to the Tjäcktja pass and he was back on track again.

Up until Tjäcktja there had barely been any snow at all and now it only seemed to aid us more than it slowed us down. Instead of sharp rocks it was smooth rather well packed snow under our feet. We kept on going past the Tjäcktja hut and towards Alesjaure. Somewhere around here I had a dark period, my quads and calfs were in pain doing the job of my bad hip and I didn't feel I had any energy left but we kept on going. The good thing was that I knew I had a dark period and I also knew dark periods end, they always do.

**Autopilot**

From Alesjaure there's only about 35k left and this part pretty much goes on autopilot. But it's dangerous to relax too much, I think Jonas would agree to that. He was running in front of me and all of a sudden he was on his back on a footbridge, it all went so fast I didn't understand what had happened. He got up again and fortunately avoided any serious injury. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">From here we kept a steady pace, just trying to get passed this part because after this you can almost feel the finish line. Even though it is a long ways to go but you know it is within reach.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">After a few more close calls getting seriously injured we reach the ever so welcomed Kieron decent. It felt like we were </span>literarily flying down down to the suspension bridge below.<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;It was the first time I felt this good at this part of the trail, I had a few pains but nothing serious and I had eaten well enough but I was very careful not to bonk here, I've done just that so many times before. I just wanted to keep a steady pace all the way to the finish line.</span>

**Having to recalculate**

We had kept steady on record pace all the way, kept track of it to not let it get away from us but now we had discovered something wasn't right. The remaining kilometers and the time didn't add up and once we got to Abiskojaure we knew for sure we had to recalculate and speed up the pace. Jonas kept us on track since he had a little more energy than me at this point, I was really focused not to do anything stupid like forget to eat or fall down at this point. He asked me if I wanted to get updates on how far it was left and what pace we needed to keep but I wasn't interested now. I told him to stay on pace for the course record and I would keep up with him.

Crossing the finish line once again, hand in hand with my brother in course record time and also a new FKT on the route. My girlfriend, my mother and Jonas' wife and kids, Roland and all of the people helping out was all there to cheer us across the finish line

**A few reflections**

This was my first race using mainly a fluid source of energy. I was using Tailwind which worked really well for me. The taste is of course a bit sweet but I noticed the "Naked" taste worked best for me, with very little taste and barely no after taste. The only problem I haven't worked out yet is how to load up in an efficient way.

It has never felt this "easy", steady pace, perfect conditions etc

Felt great to set a new pr, course record, FKT and to cross the finish line together with my brother.
