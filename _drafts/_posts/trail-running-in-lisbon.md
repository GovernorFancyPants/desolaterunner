title: Trail running in Lisbon
---


I recently moved to Lisbon, Portugal, with my girlfriend since she's doing her masters here. I like to explore places by running and since I prefer trails over roads I try to find good trails wherever I'm at. I thought I'd do a series of posts with my best tips on trail running in the Lisbon area. If you've got any tips on places to run I'd very much appreciate it!

<span style="color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-size: 1.5em; word-spacing: 0.5px;">Monsanto Forest Park</span>

**How to get there?**

You can just walk or run there and if you're a bit lazy take the bus to somewhere close by. The only thing to watch out for is to not get stuck behind the freeway or train tracks.

**What is the trail like?**

In the Monsanto Forest Park you can find the most accessible trails in the Lisbon area. A 2500 acre forest park right next to Lisbon center, it's not all forest though, there are small communities inside of it and roads and traffic, basically all the things you will find in a big city. But if you know your way around the park you can go for a rather long run without even noticing you're still in the city. Mountain biking seems to be a huge sport in Portugal, that is apparent when you explore this place. There are MTB tracks all over the place which is great for trail runners as well. If you use the Movescount map to navigate you'll even see all these tracks.

It's a mix between gravel roads, asphalted roads (very little though) and single track trails and if you make an effort you could even find some decent vertical gain here.

### Cabo da Roca - Azinhas do mar

**How to get there?**

We took the train from Lisbon out to Cascais which takes about 30 minutes and from there we jumped on b<span style="font-size: 1rem;">us 403 (Cascais Terminal - Sintra Station) to Cabo da Roca, it takes about 25 minutes. If you time it right you have about ten minutes between the train and the bus, so make sure you know the way to the bus terminal, otherwise you have to wait for 40 or so minutes for the next one. Or if you don't mind a bit of road running you can always start in Cascais and go all the way along the coast to Cabo da Roca.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">From&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Azenhas do Mar we took b</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">us 440 (Azenhas do Mar - Portela de Sintra Station) all the way to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Portela de Sintra Station and jumped on the train back to the city.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The buses are local and not very frequent so I would recommend checking the timetable at <a href="http://www.scotturb.com/">Scotturb</a>&nbsp;before going.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They will cost you about 3-4 euros each and the same goes for the train.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Also make sure to have plenty of wiggle room if things doesn't go according to plan.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><b>What is the trail like?</b></span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">It's mostly single track in the beginning, technical at parts but mostly it's well established. There are small secluded beaches everywhere with very few people but most of them involves deviating from the trail and a decent down to sea level. It's not much of a detour though and can be well worth it if you have the time. there are no place to buy food or drinks in the beginning except for in Cabo da Roca but after a while it will be more frequent places to get some energy for going on. When you arrive in Azenhas do Mar there are a few restaurants where you can eat, I'd recommend&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Restaurante Piscina Azenhas do Mar, great food and awesome ocean view albeit a little pricey.</span>

In the beginning it can be a little difficult finding your way since there is no marked trail, you have to do some guessing but as long as you stick to the coast it shouldn't be any problem. After a while you will connect to the <span style="font-size: 1rem;">GR11/E9 route which is marked by white and red stripes. You can follow it the rest of the way to Azenhas do Mar or even longer if you want to.</span>

### Sintra

**How to get there?**

Take the train from Lisbon all the way to Sintra for about 3-4 euros. It only takes 40 minutes or so.

**What is the trail like?**

Don't run close to the castles, you are very limited in where you can run without paying for it or use the asphalted road which has a lot of traffic.

Touristy.

A lot of people and a lot of cars. Few places to run. A lot of private hunting grounds.

An update will come later when I've had time to explore more of the Sintra area.

### Arrábida National Park

**How to get there?**

We took the train from Lisbon down to Setúbal which takes about an hour and cost 4-5 euros. During the summer you can take a bus from Setúbal to Portinho da Arrábida, and probably other destinations too. We were there off season so we started our run directly from Setúbal.
