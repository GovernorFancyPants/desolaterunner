### Monsanto Forest Park

The

### West coast

**Cabo da Roca - Azinhos do mar**

How to get there?

We took the train from Lisbon out to Cascais and from there we jumped on b<span style="font-size: 1rem;">us 403 (Cascais Terminal - Sintra Station) to Cabo da Roca. If you time it right you have about ten minutes between the train and the bus, so make sure you know the way to to bus terminal, otherwise you have to wait for 40 or so minutes for the next one. Or if you don't mind a bit of road running you can always start in Cascais and go all the way along the coast to Cabo da Roca.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">What is the trail like?</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">It's mostly single track in the beginning, technical at parts but mostly it's well established. There are small secluded beaches everywhere with very few people but most of them involves deviating from the trail and a decent down to sea level.</span>

Don't run close to the castles, you are very limited in where you can run without paying for it or use the asphalted road which has a lot of traffic.
