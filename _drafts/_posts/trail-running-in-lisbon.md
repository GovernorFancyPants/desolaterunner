title: Trail running in Lisbon
---


### Monsanto Forest Park

In the Monsanto Forest Park you can find the most accessible trails in the Lisbon area. A 2500 acre forest park right next to Lisbon center, it's not all forest though, there are small communities inside of it and roads and traffic, all of the things you will find in a big city. But if you know your way around the park you can go for a rather long run without even noticing you're still in the city. Mountain biking seems to be a huge sport in Portugal, that is apparent when you explore this place. There are MTB tracks all over the place which is great for trail runners as well. If you use the Movescount map to navigate you'll even see all these tracks.

It's a mix between gravel roads, asphalted roads (very little though) and single track trails and if you make an effort you could even find some decent vertical gain here.

### West coast

**Cabo da Roca - Azinhas do mar**

How to get there?

We took the train from Lisbon out to Cascais which takes about 30 minutes and from there we jumped on b<span style="font-size: 1rem;">us 403 (Cascais Terminal - Sintra Station) to Cabo da Roca, it takes about 25 minutes. If you time it right you have about ten minutes between the train and the bus, so make sure you know the way to the bus terminal, otherwise you have to wait for 40 or so minutes for the next one. Or if you don't mind a bit of road running you can always start in Cascais and go all the way along the coast to Cabo da Roca.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">From&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Azenhas do Mar we took b</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">us 440 (Azenhas do Mar - Portela de Sintra Station) all the way to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Portela de Sintra Station and jumped on the train back to the city.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The buses are local and not very frequent so I would recommend checking the timetable at <a href="http://www.scotturb.com/">Scotturb</a>&nbsp;before going.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They will cost you about 3-4 euros each.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Also make sure to have plenty of wiggle room if things doesn't go according to plan.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">What is the trail like?</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">It's mostly single track in the beginning, technical at parts but mostly it's well established. There are small secluded beaches everywhere with very few people but most of them involves deviating from the trail and a decent down to sea level.</span>

**Cascais**

**Sintra**

Don't run close to the castles, you are very limited in where you can run without paying for it or use the asphalted road which has a lot of traffic.

### Arrábida National Park

How to get there?

We took the train from Lisbon down to Setúbal
