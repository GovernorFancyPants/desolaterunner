**Ursvik**

**Gömmaren**

This might be Stockholms best kept trail secret. If you go hear you'll experience one of the best trails around and you usually won't bump into a lot of people, especially if you're doing either the 10k or 15k trail.

Marked trails all the way from a lit and groomed 2k to a fantastic 15k single track.

**Kungsholmen runt**

This doesn't really fall under the trail category except for a slightly technical part of maybe half a kilometer, but it's a classic run in Stockholm and you won't ever be alone.

**Södermalm runt**

Same goes for this one, it's an extreme stretch of the trail category but it's also a super classic run. You won't ever be lonely on this one either, especially if you do it around lunch time, since a lot of Stockholms inhabitants like to spend their lunch hour (more like two) circumventing this island. If you do it in the height of summer watch out for the wall of people getting their daily dose of sun and water exposure at Tantolunden.

**Hammarbybacken**

The crown jewel of climbing. With the most vert you can get in one go this monster of a hill will get you a total of 85 vertical meters. If you manage to find the absolute bottom before heading up that is. Here you'll find a lot of people trying to get their weekly vm's and soon you'll get to know a lot of the faces.

**Hagaparken**

**Upplandsleden**

**Sörmlandsleden**

**Alvik strand**

This is a surprising little gem of an out and back trail close to centre, with a few small loops that can be added along the way. And if Kungsholmen runt doesn't cut it for you distance wise you can add this on as an extra and get twice the distance.

**Järvafältet**

**Högdalstopparna - högdalstoppen, fagersjötoppen, hökarängstoppen**

**Hellas - Tyresta - Sörmlandsleden**
