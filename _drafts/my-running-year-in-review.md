The year started with challenging conditions for training in Stockholm after a bit of a break from running during the holidays. My Strava logs displays a picture of icy trails around the city and my runs being hit and miss every time. The body could feel perfectly fine one day and incredibly tired another, could've been the head cold suffered after new years that lingered or something else but come February things started to look better. Long runs were actual long runs and the training was consistent.

In March I did my very first speed block which took some time getting used too and I still am trying to figure it out. I did a lot of 200m intervals but it turned out pretty fast that I probably have the leg speed necessary but my thresholds are way too low, so that's what I've started working on lately and am continuing to work on.

Training week in Portugal

Visiting friend in Nice, biggest training week to date with around 140km and 5000m vert

First park run week after, a lot slower than I thought I'd be in 19m40s.

Week after that my first ever marathon distance, Sweden Irontrail Marathon, finished 7th in 3h18m.

Stockholms brantaste 49th in 19m11s

Lavaredo DNF - Ankle rehab

Swedish Alpine Ultra DNF - expected, ankle didn't hold up

Moved to Chamonix with only a tent

Lead up to MCC - Took a fall hurting my back again

MCC 60th in 5h10m - Far off prediction, a hot day
