A year and a half ago me and my friend Pedro set out on a mission to explore the south west coast of Portugal, more specifically the Fisherman's Trail.

We had talked about doing this trail for quite a while. So when I got back from a solitude couple of months in the cold and harsh Swedish mountains, I booked a trip down to the sunny pre summer of Lisbon. That's where my friend Pedro lives and from there we rented a van and drove down the coast to the Alentejo region.

Why?

How?
