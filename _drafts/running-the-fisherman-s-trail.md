A year and a half ago me and my friend Pedro set out on a mission to explore the south west coast of Portugal, more specifically the Fisherman's Trail.

I made a short documentary about our adventure that didn't go quite as planned but nonetheless was a great experience and a lot of fun.

We had talked about doing this trail for quite a while. So when I got back from a solitude couple of months in the cold and harsh Swedish mountains, I booked a flight down to a sunny Lisbon. That's where my friend Pedro lives and from there we rented a van and drove down the coast to the Alentejo region.

The fisherman's trail is probably the most gorgeous trail you can find in Portugal, it follows the coastline and have stunning views the entire way. This is actually a part of a bigger trail network in south west Portugal called [Rota Vicentina](https://rotavicentina.com/ "Rota Vicentina") which also covers a lot of the inland.
