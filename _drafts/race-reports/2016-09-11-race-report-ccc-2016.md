introduction: >-
  Things doesn't always go according to plan, quite the opposite in this case
  actually. Almost nothing went according to plan. I thought I was rather well
  prepared for this race, both mentally and physically. I knew it was going to
  be hot, a warning was sent out by the organizer a week ahead, and I knew the
  mountains were going to be big and steep, I knew it was going to be long. I
  knew all this and I thought I could handle it. But things doesn't always go
  according to plan.

The days before the race we walked around in Chamonix, got familiar with the town, watched the first TDS runners cross the finish line and talked about when we were going to cross it. We picked up our race bibs in good time before the race and watched a lot of excited runners go about their business. I did some complementary shopping to manage the heat. I did a post about [PACKING FOR CCC](http://desolaterunner.com/packing-for-ccc/) earlier but I did some last minute changes. I replaced my buff for a lighter one, I ditched my wind jacket because my base layer was sufficient to comply with the rules and the last, and maybe the most important, change I did was replacing my black t-shirt with a light white t-shirt with a short chest zipper. I'm so happy I did this last change, running in the heat with a black shirt would for sure have ended me.

**Race day**

I got up early on race day, everything was prepared the day before, a bag for the finish line was packed, breakfast was made and all gear packed and ready. I put on all my race clothes and walked to the bus that was going to take us to Courmayeur and the start. Had breakfast on the bus, packed with runners, and made the last preparations when we got there and headed to the start. Thousands of runners were standing there eager to get out on the trails. Music was playing and the speaker was talking excitedly. I was in the first start group so I had a pretty good view on everything that was going on.

The start signal went off loudly and we were on our way down an asphalted road and after just a few hundred meters a girl in front of me drops her stuffed animal and stops abruptly and bends forward. I have to do some kind of gymnastic maneuver, spread my legs and jump over her sideways. I manage to get out of that situation without a scratch but it didn't feel like a good start of a 100k race. We continue running through the town and soon the first and longest climb begins. About 1400m vertical was ahead of me, the biggest climb I've ever done in one go. The first bit is asphalt and then we continue through the woods and everything goes well, I've got a good spot and don't have to que at all, which I've heard is a problem for runners further back. I'm keeping a good pace and everything feels great. I've already got my poles out, before the race I thought of different ways of easily stuff them in my vest again when they weren't needed, it turns out I would be needing them throughout the race from then on.

Half way up, the first water refreshment was located. I dipped my buff in the cold water and put it back on my head again, even though the sun hadn't shown it's ugly face yet, it was starting to heat up. We kept on climbing and soon we were out in the open and the sun hit our backs with a fury. I had to stop a couple of times on the way up to the top just to cool down, I'm not anywhere near used to this kind of heat. I had eaten well so far, a gel every half an hour or so, but my stomach had already started acting up.

We kept on climbing for what felt like an eternity, I think I can see the top several times but once there it's just a small crest and the climb continues. I think we're at the top so many times I have to force myself to not get excited every time the thought pops into my head, the disappointment of not being there is tough to handle.
I finally see some kind of station that looks like it could actually be the top of the mountain, the only problem is, it's on another ridge. I look down in the ground and just keep on going, for a long time, then finally I look up and realize I was right. I push on the last bit, have some water at the top then set out down the mountain. Finally I don't feel sick anymore which as plagued me more and more going up with the hot sun in my back. But then, just after a little while I get a horrible side stitch and this continues all the way down, and this would prove to plague me for the entire race. I'm usually fast going down, that's where I gain the time I've lost on the way up but now as soon as I tried to pick up speed I got a terrible stabbing pain in my side.

First refreshment point was lovely, plenty of water, snacks, cheese, sports drinks and so on but sadly I couldn't stay for long, I had lost too much time. I continue on the trail and I'm going to be honest now, from this point forward I don't remember much and what I do remember is just fragments that could've happen almost anywhere during the race so from now on the chronology is going to be quite screwed up.

I met quite a few swedes along the route, some past me during the first climb, some I met along the trail and some I met in the refreshment posts. We seemed to keep about the same pace so we always reconnected at the refreshment posts. At the first real post, that served hot food, I talked to a guy who asked how I was feeling and I was honest, I didn't feel great and already had thoughts of quitting the race. I had some food, some salty crackers, threw some rubbish in the bin and kept on going.

The heat, I can't stress this enough, it was so damn hot I didn't know what to do with myself. My stomach started to shut down more and more and I had to force myself to eat. I hated it but I desperately needed the energy, ironic enough, to handle the heat. At the second post I thought I was done, I felt dizzy and didn't feel well enough to continue. I forced down some more food and thought I'd try to go to the bathroom, although I never do during races, just to see if I could remedy my stomach problems. As I sat down with my head in my hands I almost immediately fell asleep, less than a minute later I woke up and realized I had fallen asleep. Chocked and worried at first I got out and back to the tent and when I sat down I felt a little better. That's when I came up with the idea to nap for just a couple of minutes and just maybe I would feel well enough to continue. I did this and it worked, I kept going I wasn't done yet.

I'm running through a small mountain village and every hundred meters or so there are people cheering me on, handing me water, coffee, cola and it was just wonderful. The heat, the exhaustion, the wonderful people and the thought of not being able to finish made me soppy, I could feel the tears burning in my eyes and then I hear my phone make a sound in my chest pocket. I reached for it immediately since it could be the race organizers with some kind of important message, but it is not, it's a message from my girlfriend saying she is following my and that she's proud of me. I can't hold back the tears now, I'm running and crying, happy tears and sad tears. This gives me new strength and I feel I have to finish the race now, I can't quite, I've come to far and I certainly don't want to get on the bus of shame.

It's getting dark now, too dark to see. I reach the third refreshment post now which is about half way, HALF WAY. That can't be true, I've been running forever and I can't take another step now, it's just not possible. I feel horrible and people we're sitting on the side of the trail crying, talking on the phone, looking out in the distance with sad empty eyes. I grab some food, can barely get it down. I have some coke, oh coke still works great, I have some more. I try some te and it's amazing, the best te I've ever consumed. I lay down in the corner of the tent and realize there's some kind of party going on, they are serving wine and people are talking loudly, music is playing but I can't really grasp it. I fall asleep for 15 minutes or so. I wake up to my alarm, get my gear ready, time to get the torch out and a warmer sweater. On my way out again I first meet Adri√°n who also ran [Swedish Alpine Ultra](http://desolaterunner.com/race-reports/race-report-swedish-alpine-ultra-2016/) a month earlier and he has decided to quit the race. I grab some more te before I head and then I meet Daniel Perttu who also ran Swedish Alpine Ultra and I'm staying with him now. He's chocked to see me here, he started about fifteen minutes later than me and I'm usually a bit faster than he is, I explain that my stomach has given up and that I've had thoughts of quitting. He wishes me luck and I continue.

Not long after Champex there's a fork in the road. I follow the runners ahead of me but have this nagging feeling we're going the wrong way. I'm not sure why I have this feeling but after a little while I notice the lack of reflective markers and start to get nervous, the course has been rather well marked up to here. I check the map on my watch and I notice we are slightly off the track but not by much so I ask a guy running next to me if he knows if this is the right way, he answers "yes" in a french accent. I ask him if he's sure because I'm not, "I'm sure, this is the right way" he says and I believe him, partly due to the french accent and partly due to my state of mind at this point. We continue on for a while and the road starts to get steeper and steeper and I start to worry again, still no markers. After a while I see a group of runners ahead standing still and when I reach them I realize they're talking about if this is the right way or not and they've come to the conclusion it is not. The backlash is huge, instead of going downhill we've done the opposite. In my frustration I start to run back in a furious pace, passing a lot of runners. How could I be so stupid, always go with your gut feeling. Back at the fork in the road, just a bit further on the other road there are plenty of markers and here's the kicker, instead of going up, this way is downhill and easy terrain, I've lost a lot of time.

**Trail of lights**

Traveling over roots and rocks in pitch dark with only a torch as a guide craves a lot of concentration.
