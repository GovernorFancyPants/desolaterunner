introduction: >-
  Things doesn't always go according to plan, quite the opposite in this case
  actually. Almost nothing went according to plan. I thought I was rather well
  prepared for this race, both mentally and physically. I knew it was going to
  be hot, a warning was sent out by the organizer a week ahead, and I knew the
  mountains were going to be big and steep, I knew it was going to be long. I
  knew all this and I thought I could handle it. But things doesn't always go
  according to plan.

The days before the race we walked around in Chamonix, got familiar with the town, watched the first TDS runners cross the finish line and talked about when we were going to cross it. We picked up our race bibs in good time before the race and watched a lot of excited runners go about their business. I did some complementary shopping to adhere the heat. I did a post about [PACKING FOR CCC](http://desolaterunner.com/packing-for-ccc/) earlier but I did some last minute changes. I replaced my buff for a lighter one, I ditched my wind jacket because my base layer was sufficient to comply with the rules and the last, and maybe the most important, change I did was replace my black t-shirt with a light white t-shirt with a short chest zipper. I'm so happy I did this last change, running in the heat with a black shirt would for sure have ended me.

**Race day**

I got up early on race day, everything was prepared the day before, a bag for the finish was packed, breakfast was made and all gear packed and ready. I put on all my race clothes and walked to the bus that was going to take us to Courmayeur and the start. Had breakfast on the bus packed with runners and made the last preparations when we got there and headed to the start. Thousands of runners were standing there eager to get out on the trails. Music was playing and the speaker was talking excitedly. I was in the first start group so I had a pretty good view on everything that was going on.

The start signal went off loudly and we were on our way down an asphalted road and after just a few hundred meters a girl in front of me drops her stuffed animal and stops abruptly and bends forward. I have to do some kind of gymnastic maneuver, spread my legs and jump over her sideways. I manage to get out of that situation without a scratch but it didn't feel like a good start of a 100k race. We continue running through the town and soon the first and biggest climb begins. About 1400m vertical was ahead of me, the biggest climb I've ever done in one go. The first bit is asphalt and then we continue through the woods and everything goes well, I've got a good spot and don't have to que anything. I'm keeping a good pace and everything feels great. I've already got my poles out, before the race I thought of different ways of easily stuff them in my vest again when they weren't needed, it turns out I would be needing them throughout the race from then on.

Half way up, the first water refreshment was located. I dipped my buff in the cold water and put it back on my head again, even though the sun hadn't shown it's ugly face yet, it was starting to heat up. We kept on climbing and soon we were out in the open and the sun hit our backs with a fury. I had to stop a couple of times on the way up to the top just to cool down, I'm not anywhere near used to this kind of heat. I had eaten well so far, a gel every half an hour or so, but my stomach had already started to act up.
